# FlightCrew

Flight Crew is an app created to give users the ability to track a set of flights for a group of people coming into a town for an event and then assign each flight pickup to a specific staff member. 

FlightCrew is intended to be  maintained by a company such as a tour-operator or event-manager who needs a way to schedule charter bus pickups for a very large amount of people arriving on many diiferent airlines, also into multiple airports. 

FlightCrew tracks all flights for a trip and notifies the staff assigned to the flight for any changes in status. FlightCrew also provides users a real time view of the location, status, and estimated arrival time of the flights.
